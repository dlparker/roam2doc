Yeah, you don't remember why I want to send you org-roam stuff, different session, as lost to you as is my memory of what I had for breakfast. The idea is that I am building up notes of the background of my world building exercise that creates the setting and many of the details of the story. The world building and musing on how the humans respond to things is the actual point of the exercise, not the story. I have been thinking about these ideas for a long time, but in a sloppy way as the whim takes me. I want to think hard and clearly about them, and a big part of that is asking you questions to help me make sure my notions are not terminally stupid, that actions my characters take are at least roughly plausible. The story is really just a device meant to focus my thoughts on "what would you have do to next" or "if you want to do something, what do you have to do first". Given the way that I think, and the kind of answers you've given me so far, this will develop into a large (for a puny human mind) amount of information. I what that information to be available to when I ask questions. Org-roam gives me a way to take notes that suits my style of thinking, and roam2doc will collect it together into something you can absorb.
