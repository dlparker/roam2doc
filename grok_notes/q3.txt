I think this is probably a fresh session so you don't remember working on git@github.com:dlparker/roam2doc.git with me.

A couple of weeks ago you were helping me with research for a possible
story. We discussed the best way for me to provide context for questions when
prompting you for help. I want to use emacs org-roam techniques for note taking,
and there is no existing simple way to make those available and accessible to
your. So, being an experienced python programmer, I started with some example
code and started working on a toolkit for converting the org files to html
with working links between the files preserved, and then converting that to
PDF.

Attached is my first real document built using org-roam source files and my roam2doc toolkit.
I hope you are happy with it since being able to generate such documents to upload to you
was the sole reason that I undertook that SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT task.

The org doc structure is so irregular, it was quit a challenge. I am sure I will find more bugs,
but if you look in the tests/org_files/examples directory the all_nodes.org file contains a fairly
complete set what my tool can parse and render into html. Plus roam links, which are trivial when
you put the files together in one context.
Can you detect and make sense of the links in the PDF?
