1. Move all regexp to matchers
2. Change all explicit Matcher instantiations to a call to tool_box
3. Consider making all parsers have a prop that reports the tree type it creates. ListParser could have subclasses
4. Need to fix list indent calculation to properly handle tabs. Prolly make tab a level, regarless of spaces_to_level ratio
