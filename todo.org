1. [X] Make list parse handing paras in items
2. [X] Move all regexp to matchers

4. [ ] Make Paras find objects
5. [ ] Make Tables find objects
6. [ ] Make list items find objects

   1. bold text not allowed in headings, heading will be converted to regular/bold text
8. [ ] Write tests for regex tools
9. [ ] Get margin for everthing and figure out how to apply css to duplicate it. Best effort, not everything.
10. [ ] Figure out some method for the caller of to_html to supply css, maybe a callback
11. [ ] Create io.py to manage input and output
12. [ ] Consider making all parsers have a prop that reports the tree type it creates. ListParser could have subclasses
13. [ ] Need to fix list indent calculation to properly handle tabs. Prolly make tab a level, regarless of spaces_to_level ratio
14. [ ] Do some css stuff, look at https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html and https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss?tab=readme-ov-file
